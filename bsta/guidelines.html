        <li>Entries are limited to five (5) teams per school, 1 member per team.</li>
        <li>Entries must be started and completed during the current school year.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Participants are provided a minimum of thirty (30) minutes for trim flights at the event site.</li>
        <li>Models are evaluated for specification compliance during the trim session. Time allotted for the trim portion may be extended according to the number of participants and site scheduling.</li>
        <li>Participants have two (2) opportunities to fly their models for official times.</li>
        <li>Participants attend a pilot's meeting to review the sequence for making the official flights.</li>
        <li>In an orderly fashion, participants wind their models and proceed to a group timer for permission to fly.</li>
        <li>Participants place their models on the floor and wait for the signal to release from the timer. Timing begins when the model rises off the ground.</li>
        <li>Flight time ends when models hit the floor/ground or when they touch an obstruction.</li>
        <li>No repairs are allowed after time trials begin.</li>
        <li>Each participant has the times of two (2) official flights recorded by the timer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Regulations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Models are to be made of wood and tissue paper for fuselage and flying surfaces (wings, fin, and stabilizer). No plastic foams, films, or condenser paper are allowed.</li>
        <li>Models use a commercially available plastic propeller or propeller assembly: minimum of 140mm to a maximum of 170mm in diameter. Trimming or thinning propellers is allowed to achieve balance and/or to reduce weight.</li>
        <li>Fuselage dimension: minimum of 300mm in length measured with prop assembly attached.</li>
        <li>Wingspan: maximum of 50cm horizontally projected, wing chord 12cm projected.</li>
        <li>Rubber motor: maximum weight of motor is one (1) gram, including the O-ring. No length measurement is made. Spare motors are allowed during the official fights. One rubber O-ring may be used on the rubber motor loop at the motor hook end for easier handling of wound motors.</li>
        <li>Model weight: minimum of 7 grams, maximum of 21 grams. Models are weighed without motors attached. Clay is permitted for trim ballast. (Model is weighed with clay ballast.)</li>
        <li>Steel wire may be used only for propeller shaft, motor hook, and landing gear.</li>
        <li>The two wheels must be a minimum of 15mm in diameter of plastic or wood and they must roll.</li>
        <li>Acceptable flight support equipment includes the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Mechanical rubber motor winders (Electricity may not be available at every site).</li>
                <li>A winding stooge may be used to anchor the model while its motor is being wound.</li>
                <li>The landing gear must support the airplane without sagging in its rested position.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaluation is based on the duration of flight. A bonus of ten (10) seconds is added to the flight time per flight if the airplane successfully lands on its wheels and comes to a rest on its wheels.</li>
        <li>The times posted during the time trials are used to determine the three (3) top times.</li>
        <li>Following the second flight, the three (3) top combined times' models are awarded 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place.</li>
        <li>Ties are broken by determining the longest single flight time.</li>
    </ul>
