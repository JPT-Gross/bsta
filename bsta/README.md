## Flight Challenge
### Overview
Participants analyze flight principles with a rubber band powered model aircraft.
### Challenge
Build, fly, and adjust (trim) a model to make long endurance flights inside a contained airspace. Any model design is acceptable if the model complies with the event specifications. All models are to be built and test flown before the event date.
### Eligibility
-	Entries are limited to five (5) teams per school, 1 member per team.  
-	Entries must be started and completed during the current school year.
### Procedure
-	Participants are provided a minimum of thirty (30) minutes for trim flights at the event site.
-	Models are evaluated for specification compliance during the trim session. Time allotted for the trim portion may be extended according to the number of participants and site scheduling.
-	Participants have two (2) opportunities to fly their models for official times.
-	Participants attend a pilot's meeting to review the sequence for making the official flights.
-	In an orderly fashion, participants wind their models and proceed to a group timer for permission to fly.
-	Participants place their models on the floor and wait for the signal to release from the timer. Timing begins when the model rises off the ground.
-	Flight time ends when models hit the floor/ground or when they touch an obstruction.
-	No repairs are allowed after time trials begin.
-	Each participant has the times of two (2) official flights recorded by the timer.
### Regulations
-	Models are to be made of wood and tissue paper for fuselage and flying surfaces (wings, fin, and stabilizer). No plastic foams, films, or condenser paper are allowed.
-	Models use a commercially available plastic propeller or propeller assembly: minimum of 140mm to a maximum of 170mm in diameter. Trimming or thinning propellers is allowed to achieve balance and/or to reduce weight.
-	Fuselage dimension: minimum of 300mm in length measured with prop assembly attached.
-	Wingspan: maximum of 50cm horizontally projected, wing chord 12cm projected.
-	Rubber motor: maximum weight of motor is one (1) gram, including the O-ring. No length measurement is made. Spare motors are allowed during the official fights. One rubber O-ring may be used on the rubber motor loop at the motor hook end for easier handling of wound motors.
-	Model weight: minimum of 7 grams, maximum of 21 grams. Models are weighed without motors attached. Clay is permitted for trim ballast. (Model is weighed with clay ballast.)
-	Steel wire may be used only for propeller shaft, motor hook, and landing gear.
-	The two wheels must be a minimum of 15mm in diameter of plastic or wood and they must roll.
-	Acceptable flight support equipment includes the following:
    -	Mechanical rubber motor winders (Electricity may not be available at every site).
    -	A winding stooge may be used to anchor the model while its motor is being wound.
    -	The landing gear must support the airplane without sagging in its rested position.  
### Evaluation
- Evaluation is based on the duration of flight. A bonus of ten (10) seconds is added to the flight time per flight if the airplane successfully lands on its wheels and comes to a rest on its wheels.  
- The times posted during the time trials are used to determine the three (3) top times.  
- Following the second flight, the three (3) top combined times' models are awarded 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place.  
- Ties are broken by determining the longest single flight time.
